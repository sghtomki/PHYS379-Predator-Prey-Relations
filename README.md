# PHYS379-Predator-Prey-Relations
The code used to complete my BSc Project investigating the Predator-Prey Relationships in African Mammals and subsequent power law behavior

**PredPreyFitErrorsPRELIMINARY** - Shows preliminary investigations into fitting and plotting in python, using trivial error.

**PredPreyFitErrorsLION** â€“ Shows the base code from which the other data sets were analysed. Calculates the predator and prey biomass and fits using chi-sqr minimisation to return the value of the power law exponent

**PredPreyFitErrorAll-HYENASCOMBINED** - Calculates and combines the predator and prey biomass for the two hyena species. Fits using chi-sqr minimisation to return the value of the power law exponent

**PredPreyFitErrorBROWNHYENA** - Calculates the predator and prey biomass for Brown Hyena and fits using chi-sqr minimisation to return the value of the power law exponent

**PredPreyFitErrorSPOTTEDHYENA** - Calculates the predator and prey biomass for Spotted Hyena and fits using chi-sqr minimisation to return the value of the power law exponent

**PredPreyFitErrorCHEETAH** - Calculates the predator and prey biomass for Cheetah and fits using chi-sqr minimisation to return the value of the power law exponent

**PredPreyFitErrorLEOPARD** - Calculates the predator and prey biomass for Leopard and fits using chi-sqr minimisation to return the value of the power law exponent

**PredPreyFitErrorWILD DOG** - Calculates the predator and prey biomass for Wild Dog and fits using chi-sqr minimisation to return the value of the power law exponent
